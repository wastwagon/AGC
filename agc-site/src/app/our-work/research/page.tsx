                Our research generates rigorous, evidence-based analysis on governance, political economy, and
                institutional development across Africa. We prioritise work that is policy-relevant and grounded
                in African contexts, ensuring that our outputs contribute meaningfully to decision-making processes
                and public discourse. Through our research, we seek to bridge the gap between knowledge and
                practice while elevating African perspectives in continental and global debates.
